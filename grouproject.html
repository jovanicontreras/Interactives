                <a href ="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/about_data">According to data from the Chicago Data Portal</a>, the most common crimes on the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) system include theft, robbery, and battery. These incidents are reported across various stations and trains, with certain areas experiencing higher rates of crime. 
                <br><br>
                In the last year, battery and assaults have been the most common crimes committed on CTA lines. These crimes can happen in crowded trains or stations, making it important for commuters to stay vigilant and travel in groups when possible.
                <br><br>
                Theft is the next most frequently reported crime, often involving personal belongings such as phones, wallets, and bags. Passengers are advised to keep their valuables secure and be mindful of their surroundings, especially during peak hours.
                <br><br>
                While less likely, robbery and armed robbery are also prevalent, with incidents occurring more frequently in high-traffic areas like the Loop and River North. The CTA has increased security measures and encourages passengers to report any suspicious activity to authorities.

            <p>regardless of which line you take, here are some tips to help you stay safe while using the CTA:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be Aware of Your Surroundings: Always be conscious of what's happening around you. Avoid distractions like loud music or excessive phone use.</li>
                <li>Travel in Groups: If possible, travel with others, especially during late hours.</li>
                <li>Choose Well-Lit Areas: When waiting for a train or bus, stay in well-lit areas and avoid secluded spots.</li>
                <li>Stay Alert: Keep your belongings close and be cautious of pickpockets, especially in crowded areas.</li>
                <li>Use Common Sense: Trust your instincts and avoid situations that feel unsafe.</li>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p> The data used to create this article is from the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/about_data">Chicago Data Portal's crime statistics</a>
            <br>
            <p>To create this article:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I exported the data to a CSV file</li>
                <li>To create the map, I exported a GEOJSON file of the Chicago area and CTA lines</li>
                <li>I filtered the data by date and then created a pivot table of count and location</li>
                <li>Then, I exported my spreadsheets and put them in Flourish</li>
                <li>In Flourish, I used templates for a map and a pie chart</li>
                <li>The map needed the data and the GEOJSON to configure locations</li>
                <li>Once the map was configured, I used location data to add points and lines</li>
            </ul>
